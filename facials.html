<h2 align=center>SignSynth Facial and Body Parameter Transcription Guide</h2>

A common criticism of signed-language transcription systems is that
most do not have a way to accurately record facial expressions and
body movements, which are essential to the grammar of most signed
languages.  This system aims to satisfy that need.  It is not a
detailed system like Paul Ekman's notation, but just attempts to
reflect the major facial expressions used by signed languages.

<P>I have taken some principles from Don Newkirk's <a
href=http://members.home.net/dnewkirk/signfont/orthog.htm>Literal
Orthography</a> proposal for American Sign Language.  The system uses
all lower-case Roman letters, and the frequency and distribution of
letters approximates that of English words.  However, it is
distinctive enough from all other transcription systems to be clearly
separated, and can thus be used with other systems to add the ability
to represent facial expressions.

<P>There is the potential for ambiguity between "bie" (eyebrows up,
eyes up-right), "bie" (eyebrows up, torso forward-right) and "bie"
(head tilted right, torso forward-right) if non-essential elements are
omitted.  This ambiguity can be clarified if we specify the mouth
configuration.  Thus, with a neutral mouth, they become "bien," "bnie"
and "nbie."  Otherwise, the system will parse "bie" the same as "bien."
